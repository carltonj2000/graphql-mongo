# GraphQL and Mongo

The code in this repository is based on the
[Build GraphQL APIs with Node.js on MongoDB](https://egghead.io/courses/build-graphql-apis-with-node-js-on-mongodb)
video series.

The first commit:

- can be used as a minimal GraphQL server setup (aka boiler plate),
- shows a minimal babel setup in order to use new JS features with node

Run mongo via `docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo`.

Few mongodb commands:

- show <dbs | collections>
- db.<collection>.find()
